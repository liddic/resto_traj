This R code and associated article (DOI: tbc) provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of a novel application of soil eDNA-based bacterial community data for the monitoring and evaluation of ecological restoration sites. We measure patterns in 'ecological similarity to referenceâ€™ for soil bacterial communities in three long-term (>25 year) post-mining rehabilitation chronosequence case studies from south-west Western Australia; and demonstrate a 'rehabilitation trajectory assessment' method capable of tracking rehabilitation progress and predicting recovery times to meet reference-based targets.

This approach reduces the complexity of information that often overwhelms ecologically-relevant patterns in data-rich microbiota studies. We also provide an extensive exploration of factors influencing our rehabilitation trajectory assessments, including alternative ecological distance measures, taxa and sequence grouping strategies, eliminating rare bacteria, and the potential for excessive spatial autocorrelation due to sub-optimal sampling designs. 

The approach provides a significant step towards the development of microbiota-based specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) metrics for measuring rehabilitation success in post-mining, and potentially other, restoration contexts. Findings and recommendations from the work are summarised in the associated article.
